Revision history for Perl extension Net::Traces::TSH.

0.11 Sun Jun 13 2004
   - Application tsh2tcpdump.pl 0.01 released. 

0.10 Thu Jun 10 2004
   - Code reorganization and simplification.
   - Added get_interfaces_href() and write_interface_summaries(). One
     can now get statistics on per-interface basis in a way similar to
     get_trace_summary_href()  and write_trace_summary(), respectively.
   - Added write_summary(), an internal, non-exportable utility function.
   - Additional tests released.

0.09 Mon Jun 7 2004
   - Module can now provide summary statistics on a per-interface
     basis in addition to the aggregate statistics. (POD to be added.)
   - POD editorial changes.
   - Renamed %Trace_Summary to %Trace.
   - Updated __DATA__ section with the latest IANA Protocol Numbers
     published (May 12, 2004); allowed for more multi-word protocol
     names.

0.08 Tue May 4 2004
   - Code simplifications in date_of() and process_trace().
   - POD updates and editorial changes.
   - Additional tests released.

0.07 Sun Apr 25 2004
   - Same code as in 0.06, with minor editorial POD changes.
   - Distribution fix: CPAN testers reported that ver. 0.07 fails to
     pass its own tests on MSWin platforms (see comments below,
     ver. 0.06).  Since this may lead users to believe that the code
     does not work correctly, I decided to skip context diffs between
     the distribution-bundled sample output files (t/sample.csv and
     t/sample.tcpdump) and the locally generated ones on MSWin
     platforms for now, and continue searching for an alternative.

0.06 Sat Apr 17 2004
   - Distribution fix: The tarball comes with sample output files
     generated on the development platform (perl v5.8.0 built for
     i386-linux-thread-multi).  These files are used by the module
     tests to validate that the code works correctly regardless of
     platform.  For example, t/process_trace.t processes t/sample.tsh
     and generates t/sample.tcpdump.  When a user installs
     Net::Traces::TSH on another machine, the module tests verify that
     given the same input (t/sample.tsh) the code produces the same
     output (t/sample.tcpdump).
       Testing this on Linux and UNIX systems is very easy: simply use
     _diff_.  On systems that lack diff, the tests fail (ver. 0.04 and
     0.05).  I'd prefer to use a standard "Perl way" to do this, thus
     avoiding to rely on external programs.  Unfortunately, at this
     time Algorithm::Diff is not a core module so I cannot rely on
     that either.  Currently I employ 30 tests to check that the code
     does produce the same results, so users of all platforms have
     assurance that the code works correctly, but a context diff would
     make most of them redundant.  If the platform has diff, it is
     used as well (31st test).
   - Added t/sample.csv.
   - Added documentation/sample-summary.pod, and annotated version of
     t/sample.csv.
   - Additional tests released.

0.05 Wed Mar 31 2004
   - Distribution fixes: META.yml, t/sample.tcpdump.

0.04 Tue Mar 30 2004
   - Minor updates in the process_trace()/tcpdump text generation.
   - Code and POD updates.
   - Added t/sample.tcpdump.
   - Added META.yml.
   - Additional tests released.

0.03 Sat Mar 20 2004
   - Code and POD updates.
   - pt.pl 0.03 released.
   - Added t/sample.tsh trace.
   - Additional tests released. 

0.02 Wed Mar 10 2004
