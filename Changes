Revision history for Perl extension Net::Traces::TSH.

0.06 Sat Apr 17 2004
   - Distribution fix: The tarball comes with sample output files
     generated on the development platform (perl v5.8.0 built for
     i386-linux-thread-multi).  These files are used by the module
     tests to validate that the code works correctly regardless of
     platform.  For example, t/process_trace.t processes t/sample.t
     and generates t/sample.tcpdump.  When a user installs
     Net::Traces::TSH on another machine, the module tests verify that
     given the same input (t/sample.tsh) the code produces the same
     output (t/sample.tcpdump).
       Testing this on Linux and UNIX systems is very easy: simply use
     _diff_.  On systems that lack diff, the tests fail (ver. 0.04 and
     0.05).  I'd prefer to use a standard "Perl way" to do this, thus
     avoiding to rely on external programs.  Unfortunately , at this
     time Algorithm::Diff is not a core module so I cannot rely on
     that either.  Currently I employ 30 tests to check that the code
     does produce the same results, so users of all platforms have
     assurance that the code works correctly, but a context diff would
     make most of them redundant.  If the platform has diff, it is
     used as well (31st test).
